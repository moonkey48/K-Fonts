# WWDC 2023 K-Fonts
If you were to go to your dream BTS concert and send a message of support to the members, which font would you choose?

If you don't understand the Korean font, the meaning of the slogan you are holding may not be properly conveyed to your favorite. As Korean is widely known, it has also become important to understand and use Korean fonts and typography. 

The K-Fonts app is designed to deliver information on various uses of fonts and typography to those who are not familiar with Korean fonts. In addition, we will inform you of the appropriate font use through quizzes against the background of various sit down often encountered situations. Although there is only a simple function to go to navigation, but I hope you have a fun font study experience.

I hope that Korean and Korean culture will be widely conveyed through the use of various and better fonts along with Korean culture.
